PyShiny Express: Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring App
This project demonstrates a real-time air quality monitoring application built with PyShiny Express. The app simulates live PM2.5 air quality data readings and provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and interact with the data in real time.

Features
Real-Time Data Updates: Generates random PM2.5 air quality readings every few seconds.
Customizable Update Intervals: Users can adjust the data refresh rate (1â€“30 seconds).
Dynamic Visualizations:
Live scatter plot of the last 15 air quality readings.
PM2.5 levels displayed with color-coded air quality categories.
Interactive Sidebar: Includes air quality descriptions, selectable update intervals, and icons for better UI clarity.
Dark Theme Design: Utilizes the Darkly theme from shinyswatch for an elegant and user-friendly interface.

Known Limitations
Simulated Data: Currently, the app uses randomly generated air quality readings instead of real-world data sources.
Short Data Retention: Only the most recent 25 readings are stored and displayed.
Future Improvements
Integrate real-world air quality APIs for actual PM2.5 data.
Add more visualization types (e.g., line charts for trends).
Allow customization of PM2.5 thresholds for air quality categories.
Add historical data storage and analysis.
